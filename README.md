### Hi there 👋

My name is Fanqi Wan (万凡琦). You can call me Fanqi.

- 🌱 I am a final-year MS student (expected to graduate in 2025) at Sun Yat-sen University, advised by [Prof. Xiaojun Quan](https://sites.google.com/site/xiaojunquan/). Before this, I received my Bachelor's degree (2018-2022, automation) from Xi'an Jiaotong University.
- 👯 Previously, I conducted my internship at Tencent AI Lab (2023.03-2024.05), where I am mentored by [Dr. Xinting Huang](https://timhuang1.github.io/) and [Dr. Wei Bi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aSJcgQMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). Now, I am currently conducting my internship at ByteDance Doubao (Seed) LLM Team (2024.06-Now).
- 🤔 My main research interests focused on deep learning for natural language generation. Previously, my work primarily focused on dialogue systems. After the emergence of large language models (LLMs), my research direction shifted towards instruction-tuning (e.g., developing LLMs for specific domains, mitigating hallucinations of LLMs, self-improving of LLMs) and model fusion (e.g., combining the capabilities of multiple LLMs with diverse structures/scales/functionarities).
