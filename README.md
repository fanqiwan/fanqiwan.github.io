### Hi there 👋

My name is Fanqi Wan (万凡琦). You can call me Fanqi.

- 🌱 I am a final-year MS student (expected to graduate in 2025) at Sun Yat-sen University, advised by [Prof. Xiaojun Quan](https://sites.google.com/site/xiaojunquan/). Before this, I received my Bachelor's degree (2018-2022, automation) from Xi'an Jiaotong University.
- 👯 Previously, I conducted my internship at Tencent AI Lab (2023.03-2024.05), ByteDance Seed (2024.06-2025.02), and Alibaba Tongyi (2025.03-now).
- 🤔 My main research interests focused on deep learning for natural language generation. Previously, my work primarily focused on dialogue systems. After the emergence of large language models (LLMs), my research direction shifted towards LLM alignment (e.g., domain-specific LLMs, factual LLMs, self-improving LLMs, long-context LLMs, reasoning LLMs) and knowledge fusion (e.g., combining the strengths of LLMs with diverse structures/scales/functionarities). Representative papers are <span class="highlight">highlighted</span>.
